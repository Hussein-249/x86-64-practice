# x86 TUTORIALS

This is a series of tutorials to help me and you learn x86 Assembly language!

## Why Assembly?
According to Stack Overflow's 2023 Developer Survey, Assembly is only used by 4.42% of professional developers (2964 out of 67,053 respondents).

This percentage is small, and there is enough reason to focus on more common languages (for what it's worth, the most common language used was Javascript). As a software developer, the lowest language you will likely encounter is C, which is significantly more straightforward to learn than Assembly. So perhaps assembly is best left to the systems engineers.

Personally, I chose to learn x86 assembly for the challenge, and to better understand how a computer works at a low-level. My field of study is computer science and not systems engineering, yet I believe that a strong understanding of low-level languages can help me understand computer better.

However, if you're looking for something more useful to learn, you are likely better off learning Verilog, VHDL, or RTL, for competency in embedded systems.
## Part 0

We will be using a Linux environment to assemble and run our programs.

I have included a simple bash script to automate the process, located in the main directory. Rename the file you want to run to ```index.asm``` and then run the script. It will assemble, run, and then print the exit code of that program (which is 0, if everything works correctly).

Start by navigating to the Part 0 folder and opening simplest-assembly-program in a text editor of your choice, and follow the readme instructions there.
